gallery.sh
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Cyclenerd/gallery_shell.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Cyclenerd/gallery_shell)

Bash Script to generate static web galleries. No server-side programs (i.e. PHP, MySQL) required.

Overview
--------
`gallery.sh` is simple bash shell script which generates static html thumbnail (image, photo) galleries using the `convert` and `jhead` command-line utilities.
It requires no special server-side script to run to view image galleries because everything is pre-rendered. 
It offers several features:
* Responsive layout
* Thumbnails which fill the browser efficiently
* Download the original image file
* Nice and simple Bootstrap CSS layout
* Locally previewable galleries by accessing images locally (e.g. file:///home/nils/pics/gallery/index.html)
* JPEG header EXIF data extraction
* Auto-rotation of vertical images

This combination of features makes a better user experience than pretty much all the big online photo hosts. 
All you need is a place to host your plain html and jpeg files. This can also be Amazon S3.

Requirements
------------
* ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/) for the `convert` utility.
* JHead (http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/) for EXIF data extraction

On a debian-based system (Ubuntu), just run `apt-get install imagemagick jhead` as root.

Under macOS you can install it with:
* MacPort (https://www.macports.org/): `sudo port install imagemagick jhead`
* Homebrew (https://brew.sh/): `brew install imagemagick jhead`

Usage
-----

	gallery.sh [-t <title>] [-d <thumbdir>] [-h]:
		[-t <title>]	 sets the title (default: Gallery)
		[-d <thumbdir>]	 sets the thumbdir (default: __thumbs)
		[-h]		 displays help (this message)

Example: `gallery.sh` or `gallery.sh -t "My Photos" -d "thumbs"`

`gallery.sh` works in the **current** directory.  Just load the index.html in a browser see the output. 

The directory should contain a bunch of JPEG (.jpg or .JPG) files. It does not work recursively. 
ZIP files (.zip or .ZIP) and movies (.mov, .MOV, .mp4 or .MP4) are also considered. They appear as a download button in the gallery.
